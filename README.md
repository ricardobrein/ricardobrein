### Hi there, I'm Ricardo. üëã
#
#### I'm following a self-taught path to build things with Flutter, JS, and everything related to AI development.
#
When i started to learn about software engineering I truly knew what I wanted to dedicate myself to. Allowing me to explore different fields of knowledge and discover something new every day, thats why i decided to learn in a self-taught way. So stay up to date It is crucial to not be left behind in the age of AI.

I'm just an enthusiast who manipulate and try to get the most of the tools created by remarkable individuals **They inspire me**

I never stop learning through self-study (books, online corses, YT) and various professional certifications. Where I'm learn Python, Data analytics, Statistics, and I specially love everything related to data engineering and MLOps.

What really appeals to me, is to be involved in the entire *software lifecycle*, including processes like coding, training, testing, and deploying new apps and digital products. 

**I like to believe that I am part of something that has changing the world for better.**
